# aqua-sim — Architecture

Companion to [`PLANNING.md`](./PLANNING.md). This document describes the system
layers, the physics engine, and how data flows through them.

## 1. Layered architecture

Four decoupled layers. Each has a narrow, documented contract so layers can be
built, tested, and swapped independently.

                                                │  frames + risk report

                        └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The seam between layers 3 and 4 is a **file format** (exported frames), not a
function call — the Python engine and the JS viewer are separate deployables.

## 2. Core data structure: `Grid`

Everything downstream depends on a single, well-defined terrain grid.

- **Uniform structured raster.** `nx × ny` cells, constant cell size `dx == dy`
  in **meters** (physics needs metric spacing; that means reprojecting geographic
  data to a local UTM zone at ingestion time).
- **Fields per cell:**
  - `z` — bare-earth terrain elevation (DTM), meters.
  - `obstacle` — boolean/height mask from building footprints (DSM − DTM), so
    flow routes *around* structures.
  - `manning` — Manning's roughness coefficient `n` per cell (land-cover derived;
    concrete ≈ 0.013, grass ≈ 0.035, etc.).
  - `infiltration` — capacity parameters (Curve Number / Green–Ampt) per cell.
  - `mask` — inside/outside the geofenced area of interest.
- **Metadata:** CRS, affine transform (pixel↔world), source provenance,
  resolution, timestamp. Carried with every dataset for reproducibility.

The physics grid (uniform, structured) is deliberately **separate** from the
visualization mesh (may be decimated / textured). They share elevation but serve
different masters: correctness vs. rendering.

## 3. Physics engine

### 3.1 Governing equations — 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)

Depth-averaged conservation of mass and momentum. Valid when horizontal scales ≫
water depth, which holds for surface flooding.

Continuity (mass):

```
∂h/∂t + ∂(hu)/∂x + ∂(hv)/∂y = R − I − D
```

where `h` is water depth, `(u,v)` depth-averaged velocity, `R` rainfall source,
`I` infiltration loss, `D` drainage sink (all as rates, m/s).

Momentum (x, symmetric in y):

```
∂(hu)/∂t + ∂(hu²)/∂x + ∂(huv)/∂y = −g·h·∂(z+h)/∂x − g·n²·u·√(u²+v²)/h^(1/3)
```

The last term is the Manning friction slope.

### 3.2 Default scheme — local-inertial (LISFLOOD-FP / Bates et al. 2010)

We drop the convective acceleration terms (the `∂(hu²)/∂x` group), keeping local
(temporal) acceleration, pressure gradient, and friction. This is the standard,
well-validated approximation for **sub-critical urban flooding** and is far
cheaper and more robust than the full equations. Flux between adjacent cells:

```
Q_{t+Δt} = ( Q_t − g·h_flow·Δt·∂(z+h)/∂x )
           / ( 1 + g·Δt·n²·|Q_t| / (h_flow^(7/3)) )
```

with `h_flow` the depth available for flow between the two cells (max water
surface − max bed). Depths update by mass balance from the four face fluxes plus
source/sink terms. This formulation is **well-balanced** (preserves lake-at-rest)
and handles wet/dry fronts gracefully.

**Optional high-fidelity mode:** full dynamic SWE with an HLLC Riemann solver
(finite-volume Godunov) for steep terrain / supercritical flow where the inertial
approximation degrades. Same `Grid` in, same fields out.

### 3.3 Numerical stability — CFL condition (non-negotiable)

Explicit schemes require the timestep to respect the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy
limit; wave information must not cross more than one cell per step:

```
Δt ≤ α · Δx / ( |u| + √(g·h) )        0 < α ≤ 1  (α ≈ 0.7 typical)
```

The solver recomputes the maximum stable `Δt` each step (adaptive timestepping)
from the current depths/velocities. Omitting this — as the original note did — is
the #1 cause of a flood solver "exploding." Lives in `physics/stability.py`.

### 3.4 Source / sink terms

- **Rainfall `R`:** user's mm/hr converted to m/s, applied uniformly (later:
  spatially varying). Storm duration and hyetograph shape configurable.
- **Infiltration `I`:** SCS Curve Number for screening, Green–Ampt for detail.
  Pervious surfaces (soil, parks) absorb; concrete does not.
- **Drainage `D`:** per-cell sink representing storm-drain capacity. The
  "clogged vs clear" slider scales `D` from 0 (fully blocked) to design capacity.

### 3.5 Boundary conditions

- **Open / free-outflow** at domain edges so water can leave (critical — a closed
  box never drains).
- **Closed wall** (reflective) at obstacles / masked-out cells.
- **Inflow** (fixed discharge or stage) for rivers/streams entering the domain.

## 4. Risk layer

### 4.1 Hazard classification

Flood hazard to people/vehicles is governed by **depth × velocity**, not depth
alone. We classify each cell/time using an established hazard rating
(e.g. `HR = d·(v + 0.5)` style thresholds → Low / Moderate / Significant /
Extreme), color-mapped in the viewer. Shallow-slow = safe; deep-fast = lethal.

### 4.2 Sink nodes (subterranean coupling)

Points representing subway entrances, underpasses, basements, substations. Each
node has an elevation threshold, an opening area `A`, a discharge coefficient
`Cd`, and a below-ground storage capacity. When surface water surface exceeds the
threshold, inflow follows the **orifice equation**:

```
Q_in = Cd · A · √( 2·g·(H_surface − z_threshold) )      capped by node capacity
```

This gives a credible *fill time* ("Transit Node 4 fully inundated in ~14 min")
instead of an instantaneous, physically meaningless dump.

### 4.3 Alert log / risk matrix

Time-stamped, severity-ranked events driven by thresholds:
- *Warning* — surface depth approaching a critical asset's threshold.
- *Critical* — sink-node breach detected, with estimated time-to-inundation.

Output as structured data (JSON) so both the viewer and reports consume it.

## 5. Visualization layer (Three.js)

- **Terrain mesh** generated from the `Grid` heightmap; buildings extruded from
  the obstacle layer.
- **Water surface** as a second dynamic mesh whose vertex heights = terrain +
  depth per frame; updated efficiently in the render loop from the frame data.
- **Depth/velocity shader** — custom material color-coding hazard (transparent
  shallow-blue → opaque red for deep/fast), matching the risk classification.
- **God-mode camera** — orbit/pan/zoom controls.
- **Dashboard sliders** — rainfall intensity (mm/hr), storm duration (hr),
  drainage capacity. In the pre-computed-frame model these select among runs or
  scrub time; a later interactive mode recomputes live.

## 6. Frame export format (the layer 3↔4 contract)

A run exports:
- `manifest.json` — grid metadata (CRS, transform, dx, extent), time axis, units,
  provenance, list of frame files, sink-node definitions.
- `frame_XXXX` — per-timestep depth (and optionally velocity) fields. Format TBD
  in P4: compact binary (`.npz` / typed-array `.bin`) for size, with a JSON
  fallback for small grids. Depth is the minimum; velocity enables the hazard
  shader.
- `alerts.json` — the time-stamped risk log.

Keeping this an explicit, versioned format is what lets the solver and viewer
evolve independently.

## 7. Technology stack

| Concern | Choice | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| DEM/raster I/O | `rasterio`, `numpy` | GeoTIFF read, reproject, resample |
| LiDAR | `PDAL`, `laspy` | `.las/.laz` → ground-classified DTM/DSM |
| Photogrammetry | OpenDroneMap / COLMAP (external) | SfM → dense cloud → DSM/DTM |
| Reprojection | `pyproj` | to local UTM (metric) |
| Physics | NumPy → **Taichi** (GPU) | vectorized; Taichi for city-scale speed |
| Viewer | **Three.js** | browser, orbit controls, custom shaders |
| Packaging | `pyproject.toml` / setuptools | already scaffolded |

Dependencies are introduced **phase by phase** (P0 stays dependency-free), so the
repo is always installable and testable at head.
